## Integration Examples

These scenarios combine multiple concepts from the `python_mastery` package to mirror realistic, production-flavored problems. Each example layers the individual building blocks shown in single-concept files to illustrate how they reinforce one another when solving end-to-end tasks.

- `async_web_scraper.py` — asyncio + context managers + decorators for resilient concurrent fetching.
- `plugin_system.py` — metaclasses + decorators + functional partials for auto-registered, configurable plugins.
- `data_pipeline.py` — generators + context managers + functional transforms for memory-safe streaming pipelines.
- `thread_safe_cache.py` — threading + decorators + OOP descriptors for a safe, per-instance TTL cache.
- `cli_framework.py` — pattern matching + OOP command pattern + decorators for extensible CLI routing.
- `test_doubles_demo.py` — testing patterns + Protocol-based OOP + context managers for reliable test doubles.

Each script includes a failure-first demonstration followed by the composed solution, inline concept markers, and a `__main__` block so you can run them directly.
